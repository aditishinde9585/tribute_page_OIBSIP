        Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, affectionately known as the "Missile Man of India," was born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. He was a renowned aerospace scientist who played a crucial role in India's civilian space program and military missile development efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        He significantly contributed to India's success in satellite launch vehicles, ballistic missiles, and nuclear capabilities. His leadership in the Pokhran-II tests and work at ISRO and DRDO earned him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Kalam served as the 11th President of India (2002‚Äì2007), and was widely respected for his humility, wisdom, and integrity. A lifelong advocate of youth empowerment, he remained active in education and public speaking until his passing in 2015, leaving behind a legacy of inspiration.
